The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object (subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. 

Example: Weather Station (Observable) and Devices (Observers)
In this example:

A WeatherStation acts as the Subject (Observable), providing weather data.
PhoneDisplay and WebDisplay are the Observers that display weather updates when notified.
