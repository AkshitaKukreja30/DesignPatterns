Example: XML : Display
Tomorrow, XML is not supported anymore by your Display logic
So, instead of changing all Display logic, we adapt and convert XML -> JSON -> Display
So, this way we adapted the source to reach the destination
SOURCE -> MEDIATOR -> TARGET
This Mediator is a middle interface and class implemetation where we inject Source and give Target. We do all manipulations here.
